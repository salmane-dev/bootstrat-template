                                THE INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE AND DISSEMINATION PRACTICES OF Viewpointclub.com.

                                1. Collection of Information.

                                1.1 Survey Information.

                                Viewpointclub.com collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by Third Parties (collectively, a "Survey").

                                To the extent registration is required to receive email and possibly postal communications from Viewpointclub.com, this Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from Viewpointclub.com, whether at our Website, via email, on Third Party websites or otherwise.

                                1.3 Third Party List Information.

                                Viewpointclub.com collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and Viewpointclub.com subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information").

                                1.4 Other Information.

                                Other occasions when Viewpointclub.com obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Viewpointclub.com or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Viewpointclub.com customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").

                                1.5 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.

                                Viewpointclub.com currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Viewpointclub.com may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").

                                (a) Cookies.

                                A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Viewpointclub.com to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Viewpointclub.com database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.

                                (b) Web Beacons.

                                A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an &lt; img src="x" &#62; programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Viewpointclub.com to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Viewpointclub.commight place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where cosmetics are sold. When Jane, an individual listed in Viewpointclub.com database, visits the cosmetic website, Viewpointclub.com receives notice by means of the web beacon that Jane visited the cosmetics site, and Viewpointclub.com would then update Jane's profile with the information that Jane is interested in cosmetics. Viewpointclub.com may thereafter present offers of cosmetic related products and services to Jane. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Viewpointclub.com also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Viewpointclub.comdatabase.

                                (c) New Technology.

                                The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Viewpointclub.com use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Viewpointclub.com strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.

                                (d) Usage Tracking.

                                Viewpointclub.com tracks information related to the electronic mailings and web pages viewed by users and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while viewing our emails or visiting our websites.

                                (e) Log Files.

                                Log files are used to track and monitor subscriber usage.

                                (f) Optional Registration.

                                Viewpointclub.com may offer free voluntary registration to potential subscribers. During such registration, the subscriber is required to supply an email address and other personal information.

                                2. Use of Individual Information.

To unsubscribe from all Viewpointclub.com email lists, a person must send an email to http://www.Viewpointclub.com/unsubscribe.php.

                                Viewpointclub.com unsubscribe process impacts only the future delivery of electronic mailings disseminated by Viewpointclub.com on its own behalf. You may still receive electronic mailings sent on behalf of Third Parties and your personal information may still be shared with Third Parties for use in offline marketing and data appends, including email appends.

                                You should also note that unsubscribing from Viewpointclub.com electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe the subscriber's information from any Third Party associates and licensees of the data. Since Third Party associates and licensee partners maintain separate databases from Viewpointclub.com, and you will need to unsubscribe from each source individually, if desired. This allows you the freedom to pick and choose which subscriptions to maintain and which to discontinue.

As such, Viewpointclub.com does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to Viewpointclub.com email messages.
